The nRF24L01+ is a popular wireless communication module used for low-power applications such as wireless sensor networks, 
remote controls, and smart home automation systems. 
One of its key features is the Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) mode, which provides several benefits:
    Reduced power consumption: ESB mode allows the nRF24L01+ to transmit and receive data in short bursts, 
which helps reduce the overall power consumption. This is particularly useful in battery-powered applications 
where power consumption is a critical factor.

    Increased range: ESB mode uses a proprietary protocol that enhances the module's ability to recover 
from packet loss and interference. This results in increased range and reliability of wireless communication.

    Improved data throughput: ESB mode provides faster data transfer rates by optimizing the packet structure 
and reducing the overhead associated with error correction and retransmission.

    Simplified implementation: ESB mode provides a simple and easy-to-use protocol that does not require 
complex configuration or tuning. This makes it an ideal choice for developers who want to quickly prototype 
and deploy wireless applications.
